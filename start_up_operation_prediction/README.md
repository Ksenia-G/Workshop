# Start-ups

In this project, I analyzed tabular data pertaining to startups that operated from 1980 to 2018, with the objective of predicting which startups are likely to continue their operations and which may close. 

The primary goal is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of assessing startup viability. 

Additionally, I conducted a comprehensive exploratory analysis to uncover valuable insights and formulate recommendations for future founders regarding the key factors that influence startup success.
